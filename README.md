🧠 Credit Scoring Business Understanding

1. Basel II Accord and Model Interpretability

Basel II requires banks to adopt internal risk measurement systems that are transparent, auditable, and explainable. Hence, we need interpretable models (e.g., Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence) that offer traceable decision logic and align with regulatory compliance. This ensures regulators and auditors can verify how credit risk decisions are made. 2. Necessity of a Proxy Target

Our dataset lacks an explicit "default" label. To proceed, we construct a proxy target by identifying disengaged users using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. However, this introduces business risks — including label noise and misclassification — which may impact model accuracy and lead to unfair lending decisions if not handled carefully. 3. Simple vs. Complex Models: The Trade-off

    Simple (e.g., Logistic Regression + WoE): Easier to explain and deploy in regulated environments. Good for baseline.
    Complex (e.g., XGBoost): Typically offers better accuracy but lacks transparency. May be restricted in high-stakes credit environments due to low interpretability.

📊 Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted in Jupyter notebooks, the EDA revealed:

    Skewed distributions in monetary features.
    Missing values in some categorical variables.
    Several strong correlations across frequency-related features.
    Outliers in transaction amounts.
    Uneven distribution in categorical features like ProductCategory and CountryCode.

🧱 Task 3 - Feature Engineering

Implemented via sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline in src/data_processing.py. Steps included:

    Aggregate features (Total, Average, Std of transactions).
    Temporal features (Transaction hour, month, year).
    One-Hot and Label Encoding for categorical variables.
    Imputation for missing data.
    Feature scaling (Standardization).
    Optional WoE transformation using xverse and woe libraries.

🏷️ Task 4 - Proxy Target Variable Engineering

    RFM Analysis: Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values per customer.
    Clustering: Applied KMeans to segment customers into 3 clusters using scaled RFM.
    High-Risk Proxy: Defined the least-engaged cluster as high-risk (is_high_risk = 1).
    Integration: Merged the is_high_risk target column into the model training dataset.

🤖 Task 5 - Model Training & Experiment Tracking

    Used MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry.
    Trained and compared models:
        Logistic Regression
        Random Forest
        Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
    Evaluated using:
        Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
    Hyperparameter tuning via hyperopt
    Unit tests created in tests/test_data_processing.py using pytest.

🚀 Task 6 - Model Deployment & CI/CD

    Built a REST API using FastAPI in src/api/main.py
    /predict endpoint returns credit risk probability.
    Pydantic models used for input/output validation.
    Containerized the service with:
        Dockerfile
        docker-compose.yml
    CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions:
        Code linting via flake8
        Test execution via pytest
        Pipeline fails on lint/test errors.
