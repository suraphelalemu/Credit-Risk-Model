Summary of the Dataset

    Total Transactions: 95,662
    Attributes: 15
        Categorical Identifiers: BatchId, AccountId, CustomerId
        Financial Metrics: Amount, Value
        Timestamps: TransactionStartTime

Key Insights

    Right-Skewness: Most numerical features are right-skewed, indicating a few extreme values significantly influence the mean.
    Prominent Peaks: Key variables like CountryCode, Amount, and Value show distinct peaks.
    Preferred Pricing Strategy: A strong preference for pricing strategy 2.
    Majority Non-Fraudulent Transactions: The dataset shows a low incidence of fraud.

Insights from Categorical Features

    CurrencyCode: All transactions are in UGX (Ugandan Shilling).
    ProviderId: Dominated by two providers.
    ProductCategory: Primarily consists of airtime and financial services.
    ChannelId: Most transactions occur via two preferred channels.

Correlation Analysis

    Amount and Value: Strong positive correlation; consider removing Value for modeling.
    PricingStrategy: No significant correlation with other features.

Outlier Analysis

    Significant outliers identified in Amount and Value, warranting further investigation.

Recommendations

    Handling Outliers: Utilize robust scaling methods or transformations (e.g., logarithmic scaling) to normalize distributions.

Feature Engineering Process

The feature engineering process involves several key steps to prepare the dataset for analysis and model training:
Steps Involved

    Encoding Categorical Variables:
        Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

    Standardizing Numerical Features:
        Numerical features were standardized using the StandardScaler. This ensures consistency in scale across features, which is crucial for many machine learning models.

    Handling Missing Values:
        During the feature engineering process, the new feature Std_Transaction_Amount was found to have 712 missing values. To ensure data completeness, these missing values were imputed with the mean of the feature.

Summary

These steps improve the quality of the dataset, making it more suitable for further analysis and predictive modeling. Proper encoding, scaling, and handling of missing values are essential for building effective machine learning models.
Conclusion
The dataset offers valuable insights into financial transactions, with specific attributes requiring further investigation for effective modeling. The findings highlight the importance of addressing skewness and outliers to enhance predictive performance.
